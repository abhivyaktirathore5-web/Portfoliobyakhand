# How to Publish Your Portfolio Website

Since your website is built with static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can host it for free very easily. Here are the two best options:

## Option 1: Netlify Drop (Easiest & Fastest)
*Best for: Getting it live in 30 seconds without installing anything.*

1. **Locate your project folder**:
   The files are located at: 
   `c:\Users\Hello\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\portfolio-website`
   *(You can copy this path and paste it into your File Explorer address bar)*

2. **Go to Netlify Drop**: 
   Open your browser and search for "Netlify Drop" or go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
   *(You might need to sign up for a free account if you haven't already).*

3. **Drag and Drop**:
   Simply drag the `portfolio-website` folder from your computer and drop it onto the area that says "Drag and drop your site output folder here".

4. **Done!**:
   Netlify will upload the files and give you a live URL (e.g., `random-name-1234.netlify.app`) instantly. You can rename this in "Site Settings".

## Option 2: GitHub Pages (Professional Standard)
*Best for: Long-term hosting and showing code to recruiters.*

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in.
   - Click the **+** icon in the top right -> **New repository**.
   - Name it `portfolio` (or anything you like).
   - Check "Initialize this repository with a README" (optional but recommended).
   - Click **Create repository**.

2. **Upload Your Files**:
   - In your new repository, click **Add file** -> **Upload files**.
   - Drag and drop these three files from your folder:
     - `index.html`
     - `style.css`
     - `script.js`
   - Click **Commit changes**.

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to the repository **Settings** tab.
   - On the left sidebar, click **Pages**.
   - Under **Build and deployment** / **Branch**, select `main` (or `master`) and save.

4. **Your Site is Live**:
   - After 1-2 minutes, refresh the page. You will see your site URL at the top (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/portfolio`).
